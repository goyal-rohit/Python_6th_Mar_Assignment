Nominal data can only be named or labeled, and there is no inherent order or hierarchy to the categories. Examples of nominal variables include gender, marital status, and favorite color.\n",
    "2. Ordinal: The ordinal level of measurement involves categorizing data into ordered or ranked categories. Unlike nominal data, ordinal data can be arranged in a meaningful order, but the differences between categories are not necessarily equal. Examples of ordinal variables include rankings, letter grades, and levels of education (e.g., high school, college, graduate school).\n",
    "3. Interval: The interval level of measurement involves measuring the distance between data points on a numerical scale, with equal distances between adjacent points. However, there is no true zero point or starting point for the scale. Examples of interval variables include temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit, or dates measured on a calendar.\n",
    "4. Ratio: The ratio level of measurement is the highest level of measurement, and it involves measuring data on a numerical scale with equal distances between adjacent points and a true zero point. This means that ratios between data points are meaningful. Examples of ratio variables include height, weight, time, and distance."
